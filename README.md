This repository contains React.js projects completed as part of The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu.

1. Dynamic Greeting: A simple React app that displays a greeting message based on the current time of day. Built with React components and inline dynamic styling.

2. Emojipedia App: A React app that displays a collection of emojis along with their names and short descriptions. Uses React components, props, and JavaScript map() to dynamically generate and render an emoji dictionary. Data is stored in a separate JavaScript file and each entryâ€™s description is truncated to the first 100 characters for cleaner presentation.

3. Keeper App: A React-based note-taking application that allows users to create, view, and delete notes with both titles and content. The app uses React hooks (useState) for state management and Material-UI components such as Fab (Floating Action Button) and Zoom for an interactive UI. The CreateArea component enables dynamic note creation, with an expandable input field for the title and content. Notes are rendered dynamically using the map() function, and users can delete notes with the DeleteIcon button. The app handles state updates immutably using the spread operator and filter() for deleting notes.

4. Contact Form: A React-based form that collects and displays a user's contact information. It uses React components, state management, and event handling to dynamically update the form. The app also demonstrates making use of previous state when updating state. After submission, the user's input is displayed in a greeting card.

5. To-Do List: A React app that demonstrates function calls between components, complex state management, and the spread operator.
- Function Calls Between Components: The App component passes addItem and deleteItem functions to InputArea and ToDoItem components via props. InputArea calls addItem to add tasks, and ToDoItem calls deleteItem to remove tasks.
- Complex State Management: Tasks are stored in an array using useState. The filter method is used in deleteItem to remove tasks by index immutably.
- Spread Operator: The spread operator (...prevItems) is used to add new tasks without mutating the existing state.
This app shows how React handles state and function calls efficiently across components.
